 TODO: Complete the reducer function to handle all the actions as follows:
 1. ADD should add the value from the action to the result. Eg: if result = 5 and value = 10 then after ADD is dispatched
 , result = 5
 2. SUBTRACT should subtract the value from the result.
 3. MULTIPLY should ...(same as above)
 4. DIVIDE should ...(same as above)
 5. All of the above actions should also append the result after calculation to the resultArray.
 Eg: result : 0 and resultArray : []
 If ADD with value = 10 is dispatched -> result : 10 and resultArray : [10].
 After that, ADD is dispatched with value = 20 -> result : 30 and resultArray : [10, 30]
 Hint : Use the spread operator!


 Complete the above actions one after the other, you should pass tests numbered 1(a, b, c ..) to 7(a, b, c) when you 
 complete each part.
