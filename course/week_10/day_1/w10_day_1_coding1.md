# Week 10 - Day 1

#### Assignment

**SUBMISSION:**

- Pull the `cohort_1` repo
- Go to `/practise/week_10/day_1/session1` . Create the folder structure if it does not exist. Make sure you follow this exact naming convention.
- Pull the `full-stack-dev` repo. Copy the folder called `coding_1` from `course/week_10` into `/practise/week_10/day_1/session1` and rename it as `firstname_lastname` with your own first name and last name. 
- Once you are done with the coding session create a new local branch called `firstname_lastname_week_10_day_1_coding1` with your first name and last name. Push this branch to the remote repo. Make sure you don't push the `node_modules` folder!
- Create a pull request for the branch you created with the Title `FirstName LastName Week 10 day 1 coding 1`. Add any relevant comments and the coding1 label to your pull request. Make sure to add one of the instructors to review your pull request.


**Redux Part 1**

**NOTE:** Follow the instructions carefully and follow coding discipline.

**NOTE2:** Indent your code correctly and stick to one kind of naming style.

**NOTE3**: Commit your code to your remote branch regularly and meaningfully.(Don't commit to master!) This can help you manage your project during development in-case you need to return to any old code. 

**Before you start:**

Go to the folder you copied and renamed.

Inside the folder type `npm install` to install all the required packages. 

## Learning objectives:
- Basics of redux
- Creating a store
- Creating reducers
- Creating action creators
- Using redux store functions

## Final Goal

The goal of this project is to create a simple calculator that contains a history of all the calculated values. 

## Minimum Viable Product

Look inside the src folder, you will find 3 files `index.js`, `actions.js` and `reducer.js`.

Notice that there is some code in each of these files. There is also sections marked `//TODO` you must follow the instructions in these files and fill in the missing code. 

Once you are done, you can run tests by typing `npm test`. If you pass all the tests, you are done!

You can run tests at any time to check your progress. 

You should fix the files in the following order `actions.js` -> `reducer.js` -> `index.js`
