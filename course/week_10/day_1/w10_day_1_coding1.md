# Week 10 - Day 1

#### Coding 1

**SUBMISSION:**

- Pull the `cohort_1` repo
- Go to `/practise/week_10/day_1/session1` . Create the folder structure if it does not exist. Make sure you follow this exact naming convention.
- Pull the `full-stack-dev` repo. Copy the folder called `coding_1` from `full-stack-dev/course/week_10` into `cohort_1/practise/week_10/day_1/session1` and rename it as `firstname_lastname` with your own first name and last name. 
- Once you are done with the coding session create a new local branch called `firstname_lastname_week_10_day_1_coding1` with your first name and last name. Push this branch to the remote repo. Make sure you don't push the `node_modules` folder!
- Create a pull request for the branch you created with the Title `FirstName LastName Week 10 day 1 coding 1`. Add any relevant comments and the coding1 label to your pull request. Also make sure to add one of the instructors to review your pull request.


**Redux Part 1**

**NOTE:** Follow the instructions carefully and follow coding discipline.

**NOTE2:** Indent your code correctly and stick to one kind of naming style.

**NOTE3**: Commit your code to your remote branch regularly and meaningfully.(Don't commit to master!) This can help you manage your project during development in-case you need to return to any old code. 

**NOTE4**: No discussing anything about this coding session with other students. Copying code is strictly forbidden!

**Before you start:**

Go to the folder you copied and renamed.

Inside the folder type `npm install` to install all the required packages. 

## Learning objectives:
- Basics of redux
- Creating a store
- Creating reducers
- Creating action creators
- Using redux store functions

## Final Goal

The goal of this project is to create a simple calculator that contains a history of all the calculated values. 

## Minimum Viable Product

Look inside the src folder, you will find 3 files `index.js`, `actions.js` and `reducer.js`.

Notice that there is already some code in each of these files, do not delete any of this code, you are to only add more code.

You can delete any code the you wrote. If you completely broke the file, go to the master version from git and verify any incorrect changes you might have made.

The files contain `//TODO` comments and some instructions. Follow the instructions and fill in code where required. 

Ideally, you should fix the files in the following order `actions.js` -> `reducer.js` -> `index.js`. However, it is not necessary you do it in this order. 

Once you are done, you can run tests by typing `npm test`. If you pass all the tests, you are done!

You can run tests at any time to check your progress with the same command.
