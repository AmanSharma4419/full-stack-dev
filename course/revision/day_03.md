#### REVISION DAY - 3

Design and implement a Sudoku Game

**RULES**

- Write clean code and follow good naming convention
- All the javascript should be written in a seperate javascript file 
- Create a Class for handing the data and the player moves for the game keep this class free from any DOM Manipulation
- Write your own CSS and keep it very mininal
- Use 2D array to store the data needed for the game

**HINTS**

- Remember the UNIX Philosophy
  - Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new features.
  - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program. Don't clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats. Don't insist on interactive input.
  - Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within weeks. Don't hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them.
  - Use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a programming task, even if you have to detour to build the tools and expect to throw some of them out after you've finished using them.
