# Week 8 - Day 3

#### Assignment

**SUBMISSION:**

- Pull the `cohort_1` repo
- Go to `assignments/week_8/day_3/` 
- Make a react app with the name `firstname_lastname` with your first name and last name  
- Once you are done with the coding session create a new local branch called `firstname_lastname_week_8_day_3_assignment` with your first name and last name. Push this branch to the remote repo. Make sure you don't push the `node_modules` folder!
- Create a pull request for the branch you created with the Title `FirstName LastName Week 8 day 3 assignment`. Add any relevant comments and the coding1 label to your pull request. Make sure to add one of the instructors to review your pull request.
- **Make sure to include this MarkDown file in your submission with checked boxes for all parts you have completed.**

**React (Part 6)**

**NOTE:** Follow the instructions carefully and follow coding discipline

**NOTE2:** Indent your code correctly and stick to one kind of naming style

**NOTE3:** All components must be in different files and within a `Components`folder. CSS can be shared between components if desired. CSS modules must also be in your components folder. 

**NOTE4:** All static files like images must be in the public folder.

**NOTE5:** All compoenents files must have the same name as their compoenents. Eg: `App` must be in `App.js`.

**NOTE6:** You must only call `ReactDOM.render` once in your index.js file! 

**NOTE7**: Commit your code to your remote branch regularly and meaningfully.(Don't commit to master!) This can help you manage your project during development incase you need to return to any old code. 

Within the react App delete all files from the src folder and create your own files!

## Learning objectives:
- Using map to create an array of elements in react.
- Using keys to identify elements.
- Using Local Storage to retrieve data.

## Final Goal

The goal of this project should be to create a simple todo App.

## Minimum Viable Product

MVP or minimum viable product is the least amount of functionality you must have done by the end of today.

You don't need to focus on styles for the MVP.

- [ ] Users should be able to input to-do tasks and view them. 
- [ ] Users should be able to click tasks to complete them. When a task is clicked it should  line-through the text and change its color to green. 

Complete and incomplete Tasks should look like this:

[https://codepen.io/steviekong/pen/KOaOwM](https://codepen.io/steviekong/pen/KOaOwM)    

- [ ] Users should be able to filter tasks by completed.
- [ ] Users should be able to filter tasks by incomplete.

**Hint:** For the filters use `Array.filter`. 
## Stretch Goals

If you are able to complete the MVP in time, implement this additional functionality. 
This must be completed within the end of the next day.

- [ ] Use HTML5 local storage to store each todo task and its status. 
- [ ] When the webpage is loaded, you must load all the tasks from local storage.

**Hint:** Even though you can only store strings in local storage, you can also store objects using `JSON.stringify(object)`!
