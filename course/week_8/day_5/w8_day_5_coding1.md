**JavaScript Theory**

The task today is to review all the JavaScript theory we went over. Often in interviews you may be asked one of more of these fundamental questions so it is important to know them.


## Explain it simply

Einstein once said "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough".

Richard Feynman once wrote "What I cannot create, I do not understand.".

In essence you can't pretend to know something, you either know it or you don't. 

Your task here is to answer these questions in such a way that anyone, even someone with no experience in JavaScript could completely understand your explanation.

**Questions:**

1. What is an event loop? 
2. What is the call stack ?
3. Where are objects stored in JavaScript?
4. What is the task/event queue?
5. What is the difference between synchronous and Asynchronous execution/programming ? 
6. What is a callback function ?
7. What is the advantage of asynchronous programming?
