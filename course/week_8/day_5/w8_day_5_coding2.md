# Week 8 - Day 5

#### Assignment

**SUBMISSION:**

- Pull the `cohort_1` repo
- Go to `/practise/week_8/day_5/session2` 
- Make a react app with the name `firstname_lastname` with your first name and last name  
- Once you are done with the coding session create a new local branch called `firstname_lastname_week_8_day_5_coding2` with your first name and last name. Push this branch to the remote repo. Make sure you don't push the `node_modules` folder!
- Create a pull request for the branch you created with the Title `FirstName LastName Week 8 day 5 coding 2`. Add any relevant comments and the coding1 label to your pull request. Make sure to add one of the instructors to review your pull request.
- **Make sure to include this MarkDown file in your submission with checked boxes for all parts you have completed.**

**React (Part 8)**

**NOTE:** Follow the instructions carefully and follow coding discipline

**NOTE2:** Indent your code correctly and stick to one kind of naming style

**NOTE3:** All components must be in different files and within a `Components`folder. CSS can be shared between components if desired. CSS modules must also be in your components folder. 

**NOTE4:** All static files like images must be in the public folder.

**NOTE5:** All compoenents files must have the same name as their compoenents. Eg: `App` must be in `App.js`.

**NOTE6:** You must only call `ReactDOM.render` once in your index.js file! 

**NOTE7**: Commit your code to your remote branch regularly and meaningfully.(Don't commit to master!) This can help you manage your project during development incase you need to return to any old code. 

Within the react App delete all files from the src folder and create your own files!

## Learning objectives:
- Using axios to perform HTTP requests 
- Using promises
- Using lifecycle methods in a meaningful way

## Final Goal

The goal of this project is to create a github user search application.

Link to the github API [https://developer.github.com/v3/search/](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/) 

## Minimum Viable Product

MVP or minimum viable product is the least amount of functionality you must have done by the end of today.

- [ ] Users should be able to search for github users.
- [ ] Users should be able to see information about github users like username, profile picture, etc.
- [ ] Users should be able to click any profile to see more information about any given user. (This must occur within your app itself, not link externally to github.com! You can still provide an externaly link if required.) 

## Stretch Goals

If you are able to complete the MVP in time, implement this additional functionality. 
This must be completed within the end of the next day.

- [ ] Use the API to also implement repository search.
- [ ] Allow users to search repositories by programming language.
- [ ] Use any UI framework and/or CSS to make your application presentable.
